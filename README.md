# Assignment 

This is a simple assignment for us to get to know your coding skills and style better :)

In this assignment, you are asked to

1. Setup a web server (we will call this server X). (Hint - Go provides a built-in HTTP package that contains utilities for quickly creating a web or file server)

2. Design and build a simple webpage API hosted on X that uploads a file and sends it to virustotal API for scanning for virus/malware. Note that there is a public API that is available for free. https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002100149-API4.

3. Using the webpage build in Step 2, upload the files we have included in this github repository for scanning. After that, please present your results on the webpage hosted on X after the virustotal scan. Design a postgres DB table to store the details.

Note : Code must be in Go. \
Bonus - Dockerise the project

In the next interview, do share with us your setup, your source code and the results from the virustotal scan. We are interested to hear your thinking and design process, challenges you encountered, how you overcame them, etc in the next session :)
